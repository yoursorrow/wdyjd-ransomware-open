<WHATDIDYOUJUSTDO?>

WDYJD is an open-source ransomware project exposing zero-days in W10 as I find them. This source code is readily available to be modified.

Most of this WILL NOT WORK ON W11.

# Usage

I will be publishing the code that sends files to a server sometime in the near future.

You will setup a VPS that hosts files transferred by the malware instantly.

# Features

- Sandbox self-escape (Tested on Avast!)
- Auto-rehash
- Auto-rename
- USB Payloading (soon to be committed into this project)
- VPN detecting
- Self destruct
- Startup lock
- Monitor blackout
- Keyboard Lock
- Mouse Lock
- VM Detection
#and many more to come.

<CODE STYLE>
  i have a very "unique" code style as you can see above
  everything is neat, and in its own function which keeps the _Load to a minimum
  adding functions is easy, and reading the hooks and callbacks is easy.
  
  please commit and fork to your heart's content.
  

sincerely,
<yoursorrow>
